                <div>This wiki is dedicated to the humble rubber balloon. We've got everything you decorating with and
                    enjoying balloons: brand reviews.</div>
                <div>
                    The rubber balloon was invented by Michael Faraday in 1824, during experiments with various
                    gases.Definitions aside we all know what a balloon is and still enjoy it, well most of us.
                </div>
                <div>A Balloon is a flexible bag that can be inflated with a gas, such as helium, hydrogen, nitrous
                    oxide, oxygen, or air. Modern day balloons are made from materials such as rubber, latex,
                    polychloroprene, or a nylon fabric, and can come in many colors. Some early balloons were made of
                    dried animal bladders, such as the pig bladder. Some balloons are used for decorative purposes,
                    while others are used for practical purposes such as meteorology, medical treatment, military
                    defense, or transportation. A balloon's properties, including its low density and low cost, have led
                    to a wide range of applications.</div>
